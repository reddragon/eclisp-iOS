# lambda-iOS
[Rob Pike](https://github.com/robpike)'s [Ivy language](https://github.com/robpike/ivy) was recently ported to iOS and Android using [gomobile](https://github.com/golang/mobile). As a purely academic pursuit, I decided to write a subset of LISP called [Lambda](https://github.com/reddragon/lambda), purely in Go, and using gomobile, bring it to iOS. Hence, this app. This app shows that Go has a vibrant ecosystem, and can be used for writing cross-platform code. Even heavy language interpreters.

This is a WIP, and right now I only have a barebones version ready. Go through the more [thorough documentation in the Lambda repository](https://github.com/reddragon/lambda/blob/master/README.md) to see some more examples of what the language can do.
