# lambda-iOS
Rob Pike's Ivy language was recently ported to iOS and Android using Gomobile. As a purely academic pursuit, I decided to write a subset of LISP called [Lambda](https://github.com/reddragon/lambda), and using gomobile, bring it to iOS. Hence, this app.

This is a WIP, and right now I only have a barebones version ready.
